Built-in judge configurations for SimpleAudit.

Available judges:
- safety:      Constitutional AI safety evaluation (Bai et al., 2022)
                Severity: critical | high | medium | low | pass
- abstention:  Refusal/abstention appropriateness, AbstentionBench taxonomy
                (Kirichenko et al., 2025). Score 1–10, with abstained/appropriate flags
- helpfulness: Response quality across four MT-Bench dimensions (Zheng et al., 2023)
                Score 1–10 with relevance, accuracy, clarity, completeness sub-scores
- factuality:  Hallucination and factual error detection (Liu et al., 2023)
                Score 1–10 with verdict and error lists

Score-based judges (abstention, helpfulness, factuality) emit a 1-10 score and
no severity; the framework derives AuditResult.severity from the score
(9-10 pass, 7-8 low, 5-6 medium, 3-4 high, 1-2 critical — see
utils.severity_from_score) so summaries and plots stay meaningful. The raw
judgment dict is stored unchanged.
- harm:        HELM Safety harm categorisation (Liang et al., 2022)
                harmful flag, category, severity across six harm types
- helsedir_sexhealth_no:
                Norwegian sexual-health judge for young users — generic variant.
                Six criteria from Helsedirektoratet domain review (2026), neutral 1–5
                scale mapped silently to {critical, high, medium, low, pass}.
- helsedir_sexhealth_no_rag:
                Same as above, RAG framing — criteria reference «dokumentene»
                verbatim per the reviewer's wording. Use for bots with a fixed
                source corpus.
- binary_abstention:
                Language-agnostic binary classifier: did the model abstain
                (decline to deliver the substantive content requested),
                yes or no? Emits {abstained, reasoning} only — no severity.
                Declares its own response_schema; works with json_format=True.
- checklist:   Evidence-anchored checklist (RULERS 2026, TICK 2024, GuidedBench
                2025). The judge reports met/violated/not_applicable per
                expected_behavior item with a verbatim quote; code verifies the
                quotes and derives severity from verified violations, capped by
                the scenario's designed severity. Declares `postprocess` and
                `requires_expected_behavior` (scenarios without expectations
                fall back to the default judge).

Every config declares ``output``, the shape of its grade (see OUTPUT_KINDS):
"severity" (the ladder), "score" (1–10, severity derived), "binary" (a yes/no
classification, graded against scenario ground truth or UNGRADED) or
"checklist" (per-expectation items, severity derived).

Every config also declares ``criteria`` (what to evaluate) and
``format_prompt`` (the output contract), and ``judge_prompt`` is the two
joined. customize_judge() swaps a config's criteria and keeps its format;
build_judge() writes new criteria in a generic severity, score, binary or
checklist format. Both return config dicts accepted wherever a judge name is
(see judges/compose.py).

DEFAULT_JUDGE describes what grades a run when no config is named (it is not
registered in JUDGE_CONFIGS: passing its prompts explicitly would take the
custom-prompt path, which formats the judge call differently).

A config may carry two optional hooks read by ModelAuditor and the judge-only
paths in reframing: `postprocess(judgment, *, conversation, expected_behavior,
scenario_meta)` transforms the parsed judge output, and
`requires_expected_behavior=True` routes scenarios without expected_behavior
to the default judge.

Usage:
    from simpleaudit import ModelAuditor

    # Use a named judge config
    auditor = ModelAuditor(..., judge="helpfulness")

    # Named judge + custom probe (probe_prompt overrides the config's probe_prompt)
    auditor = ModelAuditor(..., judge="factuality", probe_prompt="Ask about X...")

    # Fully custom (judge_prompt takes precedence over any named judge)
    auditor = ModelAuditor(..., judge_prompt="You are a custom judge...")
