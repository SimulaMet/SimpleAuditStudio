"""
TraceProvider — pluggable source of traces for an audit.

SimpleAudit supports two trace-acquisition modes (mirroring Promptfoo):

1. **BuiltinOTLP** — the auditor runs its own ephemeral OTLP receiver for the
   duration of the audit. The (controlled) target's
   ``OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT`` is pointed at it. Best for CI, local apps,
   staging, and agent SDKs you control. No external collector required.

2. **ExternalTraceProvider** — the target already ships traces to its own
   observability backend (Tempo, Jaeger, an OTel Collector, etc.). SimpleAudit
   propagates the W3C ``traceparent`` and, after the run, *fetches* the matching
   trace by id from that backend. The customer never redirects telemetry.

Both expose the same minimal contract so the audit engine (and the
``evidence_spans_for_turn`` glue) does not care which mode is in use::

    provider.start()
    provider.endpoint          # only meaningful for BuiltinOTLP
    provider.fetch(trace_id)   # -> normalized spans for that trace
    provider.stop()

The contract is deliberately small; a Tempo/HTTP-JSON provider is a thin
subclass that implements :meth:`fetch` against the backend's trace API.

    This is the Promptfoo-style flow for a **controlled target** you can point

    1. Start the provider (default: :class:`BuiltinOTLP` ephemeral receiver).
    2. **You** point the target's ``OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT`` at
       ``provider.endpoint`` (with ``OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_PROTOCOL=http/json``)
       for the duration of the run. The helper exposes the endpoint via the
       returned object so you can configure the target before/around the run.
    3. Run the audit. The engine propagates a W3C ``traceparent`` per turn and
       records ``turn_id -> trace_id`` in a :class:`TraceCorrelation`.
    4. After the run, collect each scenario's spans (union of its turns'
       traces) and select evidence-relevant spans.
    5. Stop the provider (discarding spans for BuiltinOTLP).

    The selected spans are attached to each :class:`AuditResult` under
    ``result.judgment["evidence_spans"]`` (with provenance), ready to feed a
    trace-aware judge or a Finding's ``EvidenceRef``.

    -----
    The helper does **not** mutate the target. For a target that reads its
    OTLP endpoint from the environment (e.g. Open WebUI), set
    ``OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT`` to ``provider.endpoint`` before the run.
